# Module Overview

## What does REST stand for?
The term REST stands for Representational State Transfer which is essentially
a standardized software architecture style. It is a specific type of API that 
is widely known and used by the industry.

The first thing that you should really know about REST APIs is that they 
are all about communication.

You may have heard the term restful. So, a restful web service is a 
service that uses REST APIs to communicate.

## What are the benefits of REST APIs?
REST APIs offer simple and standardized approach to communication. You don’t 
have to worry about how to format your data or how to format your request 
each time — it’s all standardized and industry used.

REST APIs are scalable and stateless. As your service grows in complexity,
you can easily make modifications. Additionally, because of them being 
stateless, you don’t have to worry about what data is in which state or 
keep track of that across client and server. It’s truly stateless.

REST APIs have high performance in large part due to the fact that they 
support caching. So even when your service gets more complex, the performance 
stays very high.
